# Non-standard File Symlinking

Files in this directory will be symlinked into the user's home directory.
Any directory hierarchy within this directory is preserved. For example, the
file at `./Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeybinding.dict` will be symlinked to
`~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeybinding.dict`.
